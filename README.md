Breast cancer has the second highest mortality rate in women next to lung cancer. As per clinical statistics, 1 in every 8 women is diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. However, periodic clinical checkups and self-tests help in early detection and thereby significantly increase the chances of survival.
