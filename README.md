The web-app can tell whether the breast mass is benign(non-cancerous cells) or malignant(cancerous cells) through Machine Learning (KNN, model accracy- 95%)
The attributes in the dataset are in the range(1-10). The web-app allows user to enter the values of attributes and when on "Predict" button is clicked, the model works to predict if it's benign or malignant.
